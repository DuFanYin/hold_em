Phase 1: Planning & Setup
	1.	Define project scope (multiplayer, ai player, online)
	2.	Choose tech stack (React, Node.js, WebSockets, Firebase, python)

Phase 2: Backend Development
	4.	Initialize Node.js backend with Express and WebSockets (Socket.io)
	5.	Implement game state management (players, deck, community cards, betting rounds)
	6.	Develop player actions (call, raise, fold, all-in)
	7.	Implement hand evaluation logic (ranking hands, determining winners)
	8.	Create AI logic (Monte Carlo simulation, basic probability-based decisions)
	9.	Integrate AI player moves into game loop
	10.	Implement database storage for player stats and game history

Phase 3: Frontend Development
	11.	Set up React (or Next.js) frontend
	12.	Design game UI (table layout, cards, chips, player actions)
	13.	Establish WebSocket connection to backend
	14.	Display real-time game state updates from the server
	15.	Implement interactive player actions (buttons for bet, fold, etc.)
	16.	Create lobby system for game room creation/joining

Phase 4: Multiplayer Functionality
	17.	Develop user authentication (Firebase/Auth0/JWT)
	18.	Implement real-time game synchronization for all players via WebSockets
	19.	Handle player joining and leaving mid-game
	20.	Implement AI seat-filling when not enough human players

Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
	21.	Write unit tests for poker logic and AI behavior
	22.	Conduct stress testing for WebSocket performance
	23.	Optimize AI decision-making for different skill levels
	24.	Ensure proper error handling and reconnections

Phase 6: Deployment & Scaling
	25.	Deploy backend (AWS EC2, Heroku, Firebase Functions)
	26.	Deploy frontend (Vercel, Netlify)
	27.	Set up monitoring and analytics (logs, performance tracking)
	28.	Implement matchmaking improvements and game balancing
	29.	Market the app or integrate monetization (in-app purchases, ads, etc.)
