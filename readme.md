## Communication Flow

### 1. Player Joins the Game
- The frontend connects to the WebSocket server.
- The player joins a game room (`roomId`).
- The backend initializes the game state and assigns turn order.

### 2. Backend Signals the Current Playerâ€™s Turn
- The backend determines the current player's turn and sends a message (`yourTurn`) to that player.
- The message includes valid actions the player can take (e.g., "bet", "fold", "call").

### 3. Player Takes an Action
- The frontend only allows valid actions as dictated by the backend.
- The player submits their move via WebSocket.
- The backend updates the game state and notifies all players of the new state.
- The backend signals the next player to act.

### 4. Repeat Until the Hand Ends
- The turn moves to the next player.
- The backend keeps signaling whose turn it is.
- Once a round is complete, the backend determines the winners, distributes chips, and starts a new round.
